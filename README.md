# TDDProject

## Description

This project aims to build a simple TODO-app with support for multiple users. It can be used either locally with SQLite or MongoDB or with MongoDB atlas.
I've learned how to use GitHub CI, and gotten more practice with TDD, SQL, MongoDB, Junit5 and Mockito.

## Installation

Open in IDE, for example IntelliJ IDEA and run Main.java. Or build with Maven and run the jar-file.
See pom.xml for dependencies.

## Usage

The app is used through the command line. The user can create a new user, create a new todo, list all todos, mark a todo as done, delete a todo.
For MongoDB Atlas create a mongo.config file in root of project and insert:
```
cluster=YourCluster
connectionString=mongodb+srv://YourUrl
```
You can get your connectionstring from (MongoDB)(https://www.mongodb.com/), alternatively install MongoDB locally and use localhost.

It will fallback to localhost and standard port if no connectionstring is given.
